  title: CITZ IMB SSO React (NPM Package)
  description: This npm package offers an integration solution for connecting React
    applications requiring authentication to the B.C. government's Single
    Sign-On (CSS) service. It abstracts the complexity of handling SSO
    protocols manually. By using this package, developers can quickly implement
    authentication and authorization in their React applications to meet B.C.
    government security standards.
